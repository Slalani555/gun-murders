## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports.The original data was obtained from Wikipedia.

We are going to use the following library:
```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data :
```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```


## Murder rate by state

We notice a large state by state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state.


```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders%>% mutate(abb=reorder(abb,rate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate))+
  geom_bar(width=0.5,stat="identity",color="Red")+
  xlab("State")+
  ylab("Murder Rate")+
  coord_flip()
```
